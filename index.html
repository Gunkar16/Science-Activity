            which are a primary energy source , hydrogen is an energy carrier so that's why you have to split
            molecules to make hydrogen or simply saying you have to make hydrogen from something and there are two ways
            to do that :

                        <b>Electrolysis</b> uses an electric current to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The
                        process
                        occurs in an electrolytic cell with two electrodes‚Äîan anode and a cathode. Oxygen forms at the
                        anode through oxidation, while hydrogen forms at the cathode through reduction. The electric
                        current helps ions move, allowing positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to combine with
                        electrons and generate hydrogen gas. Electrolysis provides a clean and efficient way to obtain
                        hydrogen for energy applications.

                        is a commonly employed technique for large-scale hydrogen production. It entails

                        catalyst. The high-temperature reaction breaks down the hydrocarbons into hydrogen gas, carbon

                        obtain high-purity hydrogen for various industrial applications and clean energy purposes.

            <h1 class="journeys">1. High energy efficiency: Hydrogen is much more energy dense than petrol and diesel
                which means that if stored in a very high pressure storage system it takes much less space in order to
                make a vehicle go long distances .
            </h1>
            <h1 class="journeys">2. Fast Refueling Time: Hydrogen cars have an effiecent and fast refueling time compared to
                electric vehicles . It takes around 5 minutes to refuel an entire Hydrogen Tank which compared to
                electricity takes several hours . </h1>
            <h1 class="journeys">3. Environment Friendly: The only byproduct of hydrogen is water , making it a
                environment friendly which can help us achieve net zero emissions till 2050 .</h1>
            <h1 class="journeys">4. Political Assistance: Every country wants the Earth to be safe with net zero
                emissions due to which all the countries are investing in Hydrogen , so that it can replace gasoline .
                Even countries like China and Russia are investing in Hydrogen .</h1>
            <h1 class="journeys">5. Abundance and availability: The most abundant compound found on Earth is water from

                mass scale production of hydrogen .

        <p id="prob" class="all">Well this isn't the first time hydrogen has been hailed as a fuel of the future , so
            the question
            is why hasn't it never taken off and the answer to this question is until now renewables were not in a large
            scale so thats why making hydrogen required vast amounts of fossil fuel or nuclear energy which made
            Hydrogen more exensive , less effecient and a waste of energy. </p>

        <p id="prob2" class="all">There has also been a battle against public perception of hydrogen's safety sparked by
            the hindenburg disaster in 1937 . I agree that Hydrogen is very flammable gas and does need to be stored in
            a specific way but fears about its safety are overblown and also its been proven that hindernburg did
            explode because of the hydrogen instead the official cause of the fire was due to "discharge of atmospheric
            electricity" near a gas leak on the ship's surface;

        <p id="prob3" class="all">
            Some people even think that hydrogen is a waste of renewable energy . They say that we use "electricity" to
            make hydrogen and then from that hydrogen we obtain "electricity" to make engines work . These people are
            right partially . It doesn't mean if we "can"
            use hydrogen then we "must" use hydrogen for everything . Some appliances can be run by electricity and
            others can be run by hydrogen , for example trucks need to transport things from place to another asap and
            to do that hydrogen is the best option as if fills up faster in the tank than electricity .

        <div class="rectangle">"In the quest for a sustainable future, hydrogen emerges as a promising fuel, offering
            hope for a cleaner and greener world. Its potential seems boundless, with its abundant availability and the
            ability to produce it through various methods. When used as fuel, hydrogen emits only water vapor, making it
            an appealing alternative to fossil fuels. However, it's important not to overlook the role of electricity,
            which has become more sustainable and efficient with advancements in renewable energy sources like solar and
            wind power. Electric vehicles contribute to reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality. So, while
            hydrogen holds immense potential, let us not forget the transformative power of electricity in shaping a
            sustainable and carbon-neutral world."
